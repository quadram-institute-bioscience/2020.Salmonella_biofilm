## Phylogenetic analysis 
The trees were produced with notebook [plot\_trees.ipynb](plot_trees.ipynb).

## Regression for SNP visualisation
To decide which SNPs to plot as a heatmap, we used the
[glmnet](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html) package to apply penalised regression.
This analysis is shown in the Jupyter notebook [tidy\_snps.ipynb](tidy_snps.ipynb).
